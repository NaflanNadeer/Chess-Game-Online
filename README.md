# Online Multiplayer Chess

This is an online multiplayer chess game that supports unlimited players connecting from different machines and networks. It is built using Python 3.7, Pygame, and Pythonâ€™s built-in `socket` module. The architecture follows a basic client-server model where the server handles connections and game management, while clients manage the user interface and gameplay.
